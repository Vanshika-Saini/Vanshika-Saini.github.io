Document following:

•	Threshold resolution for responsiveness:

As the majority of mobile phones have screens that are less than 480 pixels wide, the threshold for responsiveness that I maintained was max-width: 500px. As soon as this threshold is reached, responsiveness takes place, and the content of the page adjusts in accordance with the screen width; this is responsive for both Mobile and Desktop.

•	Colors for the page. Use color wheel for planning.

The colors that I will use for this project are #563727, #f1f1f1, #7a431d, #ffff. The reason I chose these colors is that they give a neutral tone which is very calming and soothing. Since this is a portfolio project, I thought it would be nice to have colors that give off a calm vibe.

•	Typography: what fonts, font colors and main font sizes you will use:

The fonts that I will use for this projects are Google fonts: Poppins and Ubuntu, the reason is because these fonts looked fun. Initially, I had the plan to use Playfair Display. But then when I browsed through google fonts. I realized that those two would look nicer. 

There are mainly these colors which I will use as font colors #563727, #7a431d, #ffff. Since I wanted my website to give off a soothing tone, I thought it would be the best to use the colors which are already incorporated in the background.

The main font sizes that I will use are: 35px, 18px, 20px, 25px ; They will vary according to the context whether they are content, headings etc.
